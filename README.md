## Challenges we ran into
Integration challenges: WildPatron is built on a tech stack that includes multiple decentralized technologies such as CELO, Arcana Network, Filecoin, React.js, NEAR (Aurora), 5ire, and Hyperlane. Integrating all these technologies to work together seamlessly was a challenge as they may have different interfaces and programming languages.

Smart contract development challenges: Smart contracts are the backbone of WildPatron's fractional sponsorship and NFT creation processes. Developing smart contracts that are secure, scalable, and efficient was challenging and required a thorough understanding of the underlying blockchain technology.

Scalability challenges: As WildPatron gains more users and transactions, scalability could become a challenge, particularly with decentralized technologies. For example, if the smart contracts deployed on the blockchain are not optimized, the network's capacity may become a bottleneck, resulting in slow transaction times and high gas fees.

Security challenges: Since WildPatron handles sensitive data related to animal welfare, so we must ensure that the data is secured and not tampered with. Security challenges may arise in various areas, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, user authentication and authorization, data storage, and more.
## Technologies we have used
Celo

Custom Tokens: The development of Dynamic NFTs as a reward for contributions of the users.

Arcana Network
For user onboarding

Filecoin 
For storage of data related to health and expenses of animals and NFTs

Hardhat
Create a smart contract using Hardhat.
Deploying smart contract on CELO testnet using hardhat.

React.js
For front end creation

Impact Dashboard by Atlantis
displays the progress and impact of our proposed project. 
Illustrate how our project has affected the number of threatened species and the total funds raised. It will showcase a thorough breakdown of how the money was allocated to various schemes and animals.
